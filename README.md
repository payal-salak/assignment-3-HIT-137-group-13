## Introduction

This repository contains the code and resources for Group Assignment 3 of the HIT137 course for Semester 1 2025 at CAS-DAN13. The project is implemented in Python.

## Assignment Questions

### Question 1

Develop a desktop application that demonstrates understanding of Object-
Oriented Programming principles, GUI development using Tkinter, and image
processing using OpenCV.
we have the flexibility to design any user interface, provided it effectively supports all
required functionality.
**Functional Requirements**
1. Image Loading
a. Select and load images, from the local device
b. Display the loaded image in the application window
2. Image Cropping
a. Draw a rectangle using mouse interaction for image cropping
b. Provide real-time visual feedback of the selection area while drawing
c. Display the cropped result alongside the original image
3. Image Resizing
a. Slider control for resizing the cropped image
b. Update the display in real-time as the user moves the slider
4. Allow saving of the modified image
**Optional**
• Implement additional image processing features
• Add keyboard shortcuts
• Implement undo/redo functionality.

### Question 2

Create a simple “side-scrolling” 2D game using Pygame. The game should allow the
player to control a character with the ability to run, jump, shoot projectiles. The game
should have enemies, collectibles, and 3 levels. It should also have a scoring system,
health, and lives.
**Functional Requirements**
The game should include the following, but not limited to:
• Player class (movements, speed, jump, health, lives) - Methods
• Projectile Class (movements, speed, damage) – Methods
• Enemy Class (……………….) – Methods
• Collectible Class (health boost, extra life, etc.,)
• Level Design (3 Levels), Add boss enemy at the end.
• A Scoring system based on enemies defeated, and collectibles collected, health
bar for players, and enemies.
• Implement a game over screen with the option to restart
**Optional**
Create a dynamic camera that follows the players smoothly.
You have three game ideas, select one and implement the above requirements.
• A game with human-like characters (hero, enemy)
• A game with an animal (Hero) and human characters (Enemy).
• A tank-based game navigating through a battlefield to engage with enemy tanks
or something

## Contributions
- **Payal** -Analyzed all the requirements of question 1 and develop a code for image editor.
- **Amanparteek singh** - Analyzed all the functional requirements and developed the code for Question 3.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Challenge:** Initially faced issues due to missing modules.
  - **Solution:** Installed Homebrew and pip modules to resolve the errors.
